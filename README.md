Submit a PR that adds a new file to the [constants/additionalChainRegistry folder](https://github.com/DefiLlama/chainlist/tree/main/constants/additionalChainRegistry). The new file should be named `chainid-{chainid_number}.js` and the contents should follow this structure:
```

  "chain": "ETH",
  "rpc": [
    "https://eth.llamarpc.com",
  ],
  "faucets": [],
  "nativeCurrency": {
    "name": "Ether",
    "symbol": "ETH",
    "decimals": 18
  },
  "features": [{ "name": "EIP155" }, { "name": "EIP1559" }],
